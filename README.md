# CSG-script

A simple implicit modelling test system scriptable in Scheme.

It is based on my [sample 3D framework](http://github.com/salvipeter/sample-framework),
which uses [Qt](http://qt-project.org/) and [OpenMesh](http://www.openmesh.org/),
while tessallation is done with my
[dual contouring library](http://github.com/salvipeter/dual-contouring).
Scripting support is added via [Guile](http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/).
